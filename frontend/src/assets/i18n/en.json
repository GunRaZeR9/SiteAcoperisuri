        "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Roof installation is complex work requiring expertise, attention to detail and strict compliance with technical standards. Unfortunately, many roofs have major deficiencies due to improper execution. This guide will help you recognize and avoid the most frequent mistakes.</p><h2>1. Insufficient or Incorrectly Applied Waterproofing</h2><h3>The Mistake</h3><p>One of the most serious errors is neglecting or improper application of <a href='/servicii/hidroizolatii'>waterproofing system</a>. Many inexperienced companies skip this step or use inferior quality materials to reduce costs.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><ul><li>Water infiltration in attic and walls</li><li>Excessive moisture and mold inside</li><li>Rapid deterioration of wood structure</li><li>Rotting of rafters and panels</li><li>Major repair costs (15,000-30,000 RON)</li></ul><h3>How to Avoid</h3><ul><li>Insist on using certified waterproof membrane</li><li>Verify minimum 10-15 cm overlap at joints</li><li>Ensure use of sealing tapes at overlaps</li><li>Check correct installation: waterproof side up</li><li>Request specific warranty for waterproofing (minimum 10 years)</li></ul><h2>2. Inadequate Roof Ventilation</h2><h3>The Mistake</h3><p>Omitting or incorrectly sizing ventilation system is extremely common. Many installers don't understand the importance of air circulation between insulation and covering.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><ul><li>Excessive condensation in cold season</li><li>Chronic moisture and mold in attic</li><li>Premature material degradation</li><li>Overheating in summer (60-70°C in attic)</li><li>Increased cooling costs by 30-50%</li></ul><h3>How to Avoid</h3><ul><li>Install <strong>counter-batten minimum 4-5 cm height</strong> for ventilation space</li><li>Provide ventilation grilles at eave and ridge</li><li>Calculate grill area correctly (1:300 ratio to roof area)</li><li>Ensure free air circulation over entire surface</li></ul><h2>3. Inadequate Wood Structure</h2><h3>The Mistake</h3><p>Using inferior quality, improperly dried, untreated wood or undersized dimensions represents a long-term error.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><ul><li>Deformations and cracks over time</li><li>Attack by wood-boring insects</li><li>Rot and structural degradation</li><li>Structure failure in extreme conditions</li></ul><h3>How to Avoid</h3><ul><li>Use only dried wood (maximum 18-20% moisture)</li><li>Verify quality certificates for wood</li><li>Insist on professional anti-rot and antifungal treatment</li><li>Respect standardized dimensions for rafters (minimum 8x12 cm)</li></ul><h2>4. Incorrect Roofing Material Fixing</h2><h3>The Mistake</h3><p>Saving on screws/nails, using improper fixings or installing at too large intervals compromises roof resistance.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><ul><li>Covering torn off by strong winds</li><li>Tile displacement or falling</li><li>Water infiltration at every rain</li><li>Rapid deterioration and reinstallation need</li></ul><h3>How to Avoid</h3><ul><li>Use only screws/nails specific to material type chosen</li><li>Respect recommended fastener density (for metal tiles: 8-10 screws/sqm)</li><li>Fix all covering elements at extremities and wind-exposed areas</li><li>Use EPDM sealing washers to prevent infiltration</li></ul><h2>5. Incorrect Finishing Elements Installation</h2><h3>The Mistake</h3><p>Neglecting or improper installation of ridges, valleys, flashings, connections to chimneys and vertical walls.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><ul><li>Major infiltrations at critical points</li><li>Rapid deterioration of interior finishes</li><li>Mold in connection areas</li></ul><h3>How to Avoid</h3><ul><li>Ensure minimum 10-15 cm overlap on all elements</li><li>Use certified accessories from same manufacturer as covering</li><li>Apply silicones/butyl tapes at all connections</li></ul><h2>6. Lack of Experience and Improvisation</h2><h3>The Mistake</h3><p>Hiring unauthorized, inexperienced workers or those who improvise \"by ear\" solutions.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><ul><li>Poor quality execution</li><li>Lack of warranty</li><li>Multiple problems discovered after 1-2 years</li><li>Very high remediation costs</li></ul><h3>How to Avoid</h3><ul><li>Work only with <a href='/servicii/acoperisuri'>authorized and experienced companies</a> (minimum 5-10 years)</li><li>Check portfolio of previous work</li><li>Request references from previous clients</li><li>Ensure warranty exists (minimum 10 years)</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Avoiding these frequent mistakes is essential for your roof's durability and functionality. A properly executed roof by professionals will last 30-50 years without major problems, while one made with errors will generate significant costs after just 2-5 years.</p>"
